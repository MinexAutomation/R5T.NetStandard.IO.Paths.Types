R5T.NetStandard.IO.Paths.Types - A base types library for the R5T.NetStandard.IO.Paths library.

Goals

* Comment on 
* Compute relative paths.


Directory-Indicated and Root-Indicated

* A path is directory-indicated if it ends with a directory separator.
* A path is root-indicated if it begins with a directory separator (or a volume then a volume separator, then a directory separator).


The manipulation of paths as strings is built on two invariants of all paths:

* A directory path will always be directory-indicated (end with a directory separator).
* An absolute (or rooted) path will always be root-indicated (begin with a directory separator, or a volume, volume separator, then directory separator).




Relative Paths

What is a relative path? A relative path is a path that can be prefixed with a directory separator, then appended to a source absolute path, and when resolved, will yield a destination absolute path. More simply:

	absolution destination path = resolve(absolute source path + (directory separator + relative path))

What is the relative path from a path to the same path? This is just the empty string. Adding a directory separator and the empty string to a path resolves to the same path, for both files and directories.

Note that a directory IS a file! However, note that directory paths can be indicated (i.e. end in a directory separator) or not. However, file paths never end in a directory separator.

Preserving the directory indicator is a necessity, as many libaries make assumptions about paths that require specific path values to end in a directory separator.

Thus, there is really only one path combination operation: joining a file path (no ending directory separator) to a non-rooted (no initial directory separator) path.

Directory path are (internally) always indicated.
Rooted paths are (internally) always indicated.

* A path is directory-indicated if it ends with a directory separator.
* A path is root-indicated if it begins with a directory separator (or a volume then a volume separator, then a directory separator).
