R5T.NetStandard.IO.Paths.Types.Testing - A test project for the R5T.NetStandard.IO.Paths.Types library.

Tested Functionality

Paths as Strings:

	* Is Windows/Non-Windows path?
	* Is path directory indicated?
	* Is path absolute/relative?

	* Windows/Non-Windows directory separator detected.
	* Is file/directory path (specifically showing true in the case of un-directory indicated directory path).
	* Is path root indicated?

For all, include a test of the negative (ensure that a non-Windows file path is not a Windows file path).
